GrizzlyTime is a Java based time logging system that links with Google Sheets. It features fast setup (<5minutes), logging of individual student dates, quick student registration, flexible 6 digit ID system, etc.

## Notice
Google Sheets has a maximum column limit of 256 columns. The Date Log WILL break once this limit has been reached!
I'm currently working on a workaround or an alternative means of storing this data. Stay up-to-date!

## Features
- Individual logging of days signed in
- Tracking of student/mentor total hours
- Easy 1 minute registration for new users
- Compatible with USB Barcode Scanners
- Graphics and Application name are customizable without code
- Easily extendable

## Example uses of data
- Record student/mentor participation
- Gather statistics of student growth over time

## Downloads
Currently supported OSes: Windows  
Unsupported OSes: Linux, Mac  
Note: I would love to support Linux and Mac. Unfortunately, I do not own a Mac machine to test GrizzlyTime on. It may
or may not work. I'm currently working on getting Linux up and running. See [this issue](https://github.com/Daltz333/GrizzlyTime-JavaFX/issues/25)
